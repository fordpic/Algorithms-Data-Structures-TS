# Algorithms & Data Structures in TypeScript

This repo contains a working directory of various algorithms and data structures, implemented in TypeScript. It is a living repo and will be constantly added to any time I feel like learning about and assembling a new algorithm or data structure. I've tried my best to add sources into the individual READMe files, if you see an unattributed explanation there is a very, very good chance it came from either good ole Wikipedia or GeeksForGeeks.
