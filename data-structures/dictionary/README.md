## Dictionary

A dictionary is a data structure used to store data, generally a group of objects, in a key-value format. The relation between the key and the value is known as the _mapping_.

The general operations a dictionary should have include:

- Add / Insert
- Replace / Reassign
- Delete / Remove
- Find / Lookup
