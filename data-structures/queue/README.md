## Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that is open at both ends with operations performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order. Queues have relatively simple characteristics and can be visualized by thinking of a line to purchase something in real life, such as groceries at the supermarket, with the person at the counter at the _Front_ of the queue, with the last person in line (the most recent) bringing up the _Rear_ of the queue.
