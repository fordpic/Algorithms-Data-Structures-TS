## Linked List

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a collection of nodes. Each node contains data and a reference (a "link") to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures, and are commonly used to implement other data structures (such as lists, stacks, queues, etc).
